# pcb-detector
Project for my Bachelor's Thesis, trying to compare pcb-s and their corresponding schematics
Planning to use YOLO

some projects i have found with a similar purpose:  
https://github.com/s39674/Image2schematic - creates schematics from pictures of pcb-s  
https://github.com/VanillaHours/pcbDefectDetectionYOLO -pcb defects with yolov3  
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-16302-3 - pcb defects with yolo  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akhatova/pcb-defects - train set for pcb defects
